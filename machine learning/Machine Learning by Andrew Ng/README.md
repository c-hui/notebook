These are implements for the course's programming assignments. Don't read these files before you complete by yourself.

- ex1 covers linear regression with one variable and linear regression with multiple variables.
- ex2 covers logistic regression and regularization with logistic regression.
- ex3 covers one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize hand-written digits.
- ex4 implements the backpropagation algorithm for neural networks and apply it to the task of hand-written digit recognition.
- ex5 implements regularized linear regression and uses it to study models with different bias-variance properties.
- ex6 uses support vector machines (SVMs) to build a spam classifier.
- ex7 implements the K-means clustering algorithm and applys it to compress an image and uses principal component analysis to find a low-dimensional representation of face images.
- ex8 implements the anomaly detection algorithm and apply it to detect failing servers on a network and uses collaborative filtering to build a recommender system for movies.
