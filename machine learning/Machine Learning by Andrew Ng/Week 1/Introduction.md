# What is machine learning

Machine Learning definition:
> Tom Mitchell (1998) Well-posed Learning Problem: A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

Machine learning algorithms:
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning

Others: Reinforcement learning, recommender systems.

# Supervised Learning

[Supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning) is the machine learning task of inferring a function from labeled training data.

Supervised Learning can be devided into: Regression and Classification.

**Regression**: Predict continuous valued output.

**Classification**: Discrete valued output.

# Unsupervised Learning

[Unsupervised machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning) is the machine learning task of inferring a function to describe hidden structure from "unlabeled" data (a classification or categorization is not included in the observations).
