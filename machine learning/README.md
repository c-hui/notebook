Recently, I decide to start a note about machine learning. I will study the following three courses on machine learning in order:

- [ ] [Machine Learning by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome)
- [ ] Machine Learning Foundations by [Tien Lin](http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~htlin/mooc/)
- [ ] Machine Learning Techniques by [Tien Lin](http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~htlin/mooc/)

Unfortunately, github's markdown doesn't support mathjax or any other similar tools.

The note about [Machine Learning by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome) is in [here](http://note.youdao.com/noteshare?id=a171c18bdd80233e94672741c866ce1c). Most content are from the course's ppts.
